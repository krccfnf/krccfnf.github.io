				Gideon
had seventy sons
	who were his own offspring,
		for he had
	many wives
(many wives remain).
in the brevity
	of hotel stays
the nightstand stands
						empty
save the bible. 				does
		Jesus weep
at the loneliness? 	does
		Paul,
when David climbs in with
	Jonathon, arresting him close
like prison bars?
Paul was the traveling type
and also the type			to leave
	a bible in his wake
trading, he hoped
a transitory nightstand
	for a more lasting home.

            <div class="origPub"><p>One of five poems originally published in <span style="font-style:italic">Anatomy of Our Nightstands</span>, a zine curated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yusiiiiliu/" class="plainLink">by Yusi Liu</a> for <a href="https://www.littlebookwi.com/place-spaces-edition-3" class="plainLink">the Spring 2021 edition of the Little Book Project in Madison.</a> You will note some recurrent themes in the poems, chiefly angst (originating with me) and certain motifs picked up from a 2018 exhibition Yusi held in her home in Madison. It examined, in part, the functions of and associations between domestic spaces and objects (including the impetus for the Little Book: what one might keep in a nightstand that one keeps nowhere else, like contraception, drugs, personal effects, purely utilitarian objects, etc.).<!-- This one was an absolute monster to format in html x_x --></p></div>
