        <h1>autoanthropology</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>Documenting the rituals was tedious<br />
            and exhausting, and I never finished;<br />
            for the hands alone there were a thousand<br />
            spread over countless hours.<br /><br />
            For each sink there was a specific sequence,<br />
            immutable and repeated at each encounter;<br />
            and when hands get washed a hundred times a day<br />
            there are a lot of different sinks to make rituals for.<br /><br />
            At home it was least fraught;<br />
            so long as the hands were washed twice<br />
            in succession, it sufficed to satisfy<br />
            whatever was to be satisfied (but never really was),<br /><br />
            though, of late, a peculiarity had developed,<br />
            that the hands were not “clean”<br />
            (whatever that may really mean)<br />
            unless the washing was finished with cold water.<br /><br />
            Outside, in the world, it was all different.<br />
            At the parents’ house, the first washing<br />
            had to be in the bathroom sink<br />
            and at least two subsequent washings in the kitchen,<br /><br />
            and, to dry, a separate towel was needed.<br />
            How he lived for so many years there,<br />
            with all that motion, remains perplexing<br />
            but a point for study nonetheless.<br /><br />
            But forgetting the endless patterns of the old,<br />
            consider the new. Life was a scouting mission:<br />
            bathroom doors were the first obstacle,<br />
            push or pull. Push was, of course, preferable:<br /><br />
            if it was push, the door would be held open (by foot)<br />
            to see if there were paper towels inside;<br />
            if not, the bathroom was abandoned.<br />
            But if the door was pull, and the need to wash desperate,<br /><br />
            entrance was necessary, though it polluted the hand<br />
            and made washing inescapable.<br />
            Exiting would be easy, as a foot could push out,<br />
            regardless of towels; but if there were no towels<br /><br />
            and the faucets were manual, a new complication arose;<br />
            when the washing was done, a hand<br />
            could not touch the faucet knobs, lest it be re-polluted,<br />
            and so a foot would be hoisted up to the counter,<br /><br />
            while spinning awkwardly on the other leg,<br />
            risking balance and a fall to a floor of contagion,<br />
            simply to silence the water that was likely left scalding<br />
            for he could not adjust the temperature while washing.<br /><br />
            In public, the total number of washings always had to be odd;<br />
            the first round of washing a day had to be three<br />
            and all subsequent washings in multiples of two;<br />
            and always five pumps of soap per washing<br /><br />
            (per each washing, that is, not per each bathroom excursion),<br />
            and if the dispenser was manual, then soap<br />
            would be wiped at the base of the palm<br />
            and rinsed off separately before lathering<br /><br />
            to cleanse the part that touched the pollution on the dispenser.<br />
            And then to scrub until no soap could be felt,<br />
            even if it meant bleeding and missing class.<br />
            And all that was just the start of it; I never finished.</p>
            <div class="origPub"><p>This poem was a finalist for the 2017 Ron Wallace Poetry Prize (or perhaps 2018; there is no archive of how the dating system used to work for the prize in relation to the academic year). It has remained unposted until now because I had hoped to revise it and get it published elsewhere, but over the years I have realized that I am not capable of balancing the tedium of what is being described with what would make the poem compelling to read. But, as always, I will include here anything that resembles a laurel in my cap.</p></div>
