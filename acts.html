        <h1>acts</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>If all the world’s a stage,<br />
            then I should wish to play<br />
            and act the early acts<br />
            when all was light and gay.<br /><br />
            Of all my seven roles,<br />
            I think that three are spent;<br />
            for when I saw her face,<br />
            my heart no more was rent.<br /><br />
            My sighs—a furnace hot<br />
            (as Will was wont to say)—<br />
            have cooled, and now a beard<br />
            has grown upon my face—<br /><br />
            and now my oaths are firm<br />
            (or more so than before)<br />
            and though I try to run<br />
            I care for honor more.<br /><br />
            I stare the cannon down<br />
            and pray to make it fast—<br />
            for without love, I fear<br />
            that I will never last.</p>
