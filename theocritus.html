          <h2>Theocritus (translated by Matthew Stokdyk)</h2>
          <p><br /><span style="font-style:italic">The Cyclops to Galatea; in heroic couplets and loosely after Marlowe's elegiac style</span><br /><br />
            “I know, thou graceful girl, why ‘tis you flee:<br />
            this single, shaggy brow that marketh me,<br />
            that stretcheth long from ear to ear across<br />
            my face entire, and ‘neath it there ensconced<br />
            my single eye, and then my giant nose<br />
            that sits above my lip. And so it goes<br />
            that I am so—but wait, I shepherd here<br />
            a thousand sheep, and from them draw what’s clear<br />
            the greatest milk, and drink it up, and ne’er<br />
            I’m left without some cheese in summer air<br />
            or spring or winter’s height, and full indeed<br />
            my baskets always lie. Of all my breed<br />
            of Cyclops kin, I whistle far the best,<br />
            and sing of you and I when others rest<br />
            in dead of night, my dearest apple sweet.<br />
            And now, for you, with collars all replete,<br />
            I’m raising here eleven fawns, and too<br />
            these yearling cubs of bears, all four for you.<br />
            So come to me, and nothing less you’ll have,<br />
            and leave the greenish sea its sandy half<br />
            to beat. More pleasant will you spend the night<br />
            inside the cave with me. So come, delight:<br />
            inside are laurels, slender cypress trees,<br />
            and ivy dark, and sweet-fruit vines for thee,<br />
            and chilly water wooded Etna bears<br />
            for me from whitest snow, without compare,<br />
            a drink divine. So who would have the sea<br />
            or choose the waves before these things you see?<br />
            If yet to you too shaggy do I seem,<br />
            I have beside the pit some oaken beams<br />
            and restless fire that burns beneath the ash—<br />
            and burning thus for you, full unabashed,<br />
            I’d offer up my soul and single eye;<br />
            there is no sweeter thing to me and mine.”</p>

I'm still unhappy with the enjambment throughout, as well as the fact that I only use archaisms in the first three lines. I may revise it in the future.<br /><br />Matthew Stokdyk &#169; 2018.
