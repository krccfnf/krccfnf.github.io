          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>“Your daughter has become<br />
            quite the Bohemian, and I<br />
            would like to be Bohemian, also,<br />
            with her.”<br />
            <span style="padding-left:6em">She really could</span><br />
            draw, and color the smoke<br />
            (she always drew people smoking)<br />
            just right in a rainbow—<br />
            she asked me (as if I were an artist)<br />
            to write her a poem to draw on,<br />
            just a one-off forgotten forever like Blake,<br />
            but I couldn’t do it.<br />
            <span style="font-style:italic;padding-left:1.5em">“That’s not really how I work—”</span><br />
            <span style="font-style:italic;padding-left:3em">“Then figure it out.”</span><br />
            And I tried, and worked for many months<br />
            crafting the perfect little verse<br />
            for her to scribble over, but by then<br />
            she had deleted her Messenger again.<br />
            So I printed it off and<br />
            tried to make it pretty, tried to<br />
            make up with colors<br />
            what wasn’t in the words.<br />
            But I can’t draw.<br />
            So I burned it, out on the frozen lake.<br />
            And the smoke was white<br />
            against the white snow and<br />
            black sky bleached of stars by the city lights—<br />
            maybe I missed the rainbow, as it burned.<br />
            But really I don’t think my hand<br />
            could ever make smoke like her.</p>

I archived it, but, in case the imagery is not clear, <a href="https://matthewstokdyk.com/instagram/2019-04-08_4.jpg">here is the final section of it</a> with my own crude approximation of her sort of drawing.</p></div>
