        <h1>ikea</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>The nightstand was assembled precisely by its IKEA instructions;<br />
            each piece was laid out and organized, arranged, and straightened.<br /><br />
            Construction was sequential. Each dowel was inserted with care<br />
            and each screw was tightened until little give remained.<br /><br />
            After assembly, it was fitted exactly in the room,<br />
            an equidistant three inches from the wall, bed, and bookshelf.<br /><br />
            Then a paper towel was taken, and wetted, and rung,<br />
            and each surface (save the bottom, I am not mad) was wiped down,<br /><br />
            except the top and inside portions, which were first sanitized<br />
            and left to dry fully, and then wiped down,<br /><br />
            and then everything was dried with two paper towels,<br />
            thus ensuring all pollution was removed from the furniture.<br /><br />
            Sterile, it was ready for filling. But it stood half-empty:<br />
            the bottom drawer was quickly fed clothing<br /><br />
            while the top remained hungry.<br />
            My effects had grown rather impersonal,<br /><br />
            and thus there was nothing to store there<br />
            that could not be kept in pockets.<br /><br />
            There was no lover, and thus it could not hold<br />
            hair bands or dental dams or love letters.<br /><br />
            But soon enough I found a use, and filled it full<br />
            with select dishes and sparse cutlery.<br /><br />
            I had grown afraid of the kitchen, and the miasma<br />
            that inhabited it, and could not bring myself<br /><br />
            to even touch what remained there unwashed.<br />
            So I segregated a portion and scrubbed for two hours<br /><br />
            and kept them in my room. It didnâ€™t do much good, though,<br />
            since I could only wash them when alone,<br /><br />
            meaning I could only eat at home when alone<br />
            with enough time to scrub afterwards. So it was easier<br /><br />
            just to stop eating, more or less. But it was fine.<br />
            The drawer, at least, was more personal than ever.</p>
            <div class="origPub"><p>One of five poems originally published in <span style="font-style:italic">Anatomy of Our Nightstands</span>, a zine curated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yusiiiiliu/" class="plainLink">by Yusi Liu</a> for <a href="https://www.littlebookwi.com/place-spaces-edition-3" class="plainLink">the Spring 2021 edition of the Little Book Project in Madison.</a> You will note some recurrent themes in the poems, chiefly angst (originating with me) and certain motifs picked up from a 2018 exhibition Yusi held in her home in Madison. It examined, in part, the functions of and associations between domestic spaces and objects (including the impetus for the Little Book: what one might keep in a nightstand that one keeps nowhere else, like contraception, drugs, personal effects, purely utilitarian objects, etc.).</p></div>
