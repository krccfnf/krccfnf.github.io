        <h1>meditation</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>the ethereal sounds again<br />
            as i am crosslegged on the top bunk<br />
            back leaned against the concrete wall<br />
            painted white in the fifties,<br />
            now an ivory cream.<br />
            there is a bourdon in the back<br />
            solid, firm, like the cheap mattress<br />
            on which i am perched, freshman.<br />
            and above it undulates<br />
            a great many unplaceable sounds:<br />
            a woman’s voice (not yours,<br />
            though faint and trembling<br />
            like when you first sang for me)<br />
            not the wind but an echo of the wind<br />
            and the sound i imagine stars make;<br />
            and in the room, the sound of lake ice and fever.<br />
            trying to meditate but really half-asleep<br />
            never one for it before, but you<br />
            brought a reality i couldn’t process<br />
            in my endless processing,<br />
            the spiraling that leads me wash my hands<br />
            that leads me count the breaths<br />
            count the lights in the rooms<br />
            where i sit and scribble an A test<br />
            but think only of what it is you’re feeling<br />
            for him, in love with you and you with me<br />
            and me with him and you with him<br />
            and you with death and me with<br />
            all of it.</p>
