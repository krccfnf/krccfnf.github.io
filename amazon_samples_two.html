        <h1>Additional Image Samples</h1>
          <p>As requested, please find some additional image samples below. The first set of image samples I sent <a href=:https"//matthewstokdyk.com/amazon_samples">can be found here. The GIFs are all sampled from Amazon properties and highlight positive interactions in the show that could be used to show reactions and employee appreciation. The logo, similarly, is derived from Amazon's current logo.</a></p>
            <ul><li><a href="https://matthewstokdyk.com/amazonImages/secondRound/ringsOfPower.gif">Animated GIF from <span style="font-style:italic">Rings of Power</span></a></li>
            <ul><li><a href="https://matthewstokdyk.com/amazonImages/secondRound/wheelOfTime1.gif">Animated GIF from <span style="font-style:italic">Wheel of Time</span></a></li>
            <ul><li><a href="https://matthewstokdyk.com/amazonImages/secondRound/wheelOfTime2.gif">Animated GIF from <span style="font-style:italic">Wheel of Time</span></a> (continuing the previous scene but with a different application)</li>
            <ul><li><a href="https://matthewstokdyk.com/amazonImages/secondRound/aPlusLogoMockup.png">A quick and sample draft of a logo</li> (as explained in the email, the concept—which could certainly use further aesthetic modifications—was made without knowing the name of the platform. Regardless, derived from Amazon's primary logo, I have created a logo that reads "A+" using the Amazon "a" and a "+" created from the Amazon arrow in an attempt to keep in theme with employee appreciation; that is, it's as if the user has received an A+ by being congratulated on the platform)
