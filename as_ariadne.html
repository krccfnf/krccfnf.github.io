        <h1>as ariadne</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>you found me breasts bared,<br />
            sand wearing away marble toes, glass by the sun;<br />
            grapes would have ripened, dark<br />
            against the sea.<br /><br />
            <span style="padding-left:6em">and you were speckled,</span><br />
            hollow points and round in leopard pelt.<br />
            how absurd, I thought, a pinecone on a stick.<br />
            how drunk you must’ve been to fashion such a wand.<br /><br />
            but wants of gods are not my concern<br />
            as you unlaced me that night,<br />
            a spool untwisting in labyrinthine blackness,<br />
            the baying of my poor brother locked in the basement<br />
            in my head as soon my mouth<br />
            made cries fit and ecstatic<br />
            as a horn tearing through an athenian youth.<br /><br />
            what sparrow plucks at our crowns,<br />
            what starlings roost and ravens crow?<br />
            the amaretto fires coruscating in your eyes,<br />
            burning like a swallow of your blood.<br /><br />
            and really I miss theseus dearly—<br />
            for who could love a god<br />
            when a brute had stolen their heart?</p>
