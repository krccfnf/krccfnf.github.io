        <h1>Sappho, Death, and Memory</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>When Solon the Athenian, son of Execestides, heard his nephew sing a song of Sappho along with the wine, he liked it and told the child to teach it to him. When someone asked for what reason he was so eager, he said “so that, having learned it, I might die.”<sup>[1]</sup><br /><br />

              <sup>[1]</sup> This passage, attributed to Aelian, comes from Stobaeus' <span style="font-style:italic">Anthology</span> (taken here from the Loeb volume):<br /><br />
              <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">Σόλων ὁ Ἀθηναῖος ὁ Ἐξηκεστίδου παρὰ πότον τοῦ ἀδελφιδοῦ αὐτοῦ μέλος τι Σαπφοῦς ᾄσαντος ἥσθη τῷ μέλει καὶ προσέταξε τῷ μειρακίῳ διδάξαι αὐτόν· ἐρωτήσαντος δέ τινος διὰ ποίαν αἰτίαν τοῦτο ἐσπούδασεν, ὁ δὲ ἔφη, ἵνα μαθὼν αὐτὸ ἀποθάνω.</span><br /><br />
              Full disclosure, though, I had no idea how to render <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">διὰ ποίαν αἰτίαν</span>.<br /><br />
              <sup>[2]</sup> This passage is Sappho fragment 55 according to the Lobel-Page numbering. It survives partially quoted in Plutarch's <span style="font-style:italic">Moralia</span> and more completely, again, in Stobaeus' <span style="font-style:italic">Anthology</span>. It is prefaced with <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">Σαπφοῦς πρὸς ἀπαίδευτον γυναῖκα</span>, "of Sappho to an uneducated woman." Here is the Loeb version:<br /><br />
              κατθάνοισα δὲ κείσῃ οὐδέ ποτα μναμοσύνα σέθεν<br />
              ἔσσετ᾿ οὐδὲ πόθα εἰς ὔστερον· οὐ γὰρ πεδέχῃς βρόδων<br />
              τὼν ἐκ Πιερίας, ἀλλ᾿ ἀφάνης κἀν Ἀίδα δόμῳ<br />
              φοιτάσῃς πεδ᾿ ἀμαύρων νεκύων ἐκπεποταμένα.<br /><br />
              The meter seems somewhat corrupt. However, given that it is quoted in two different sources at different lengths, and that the following verse seems to respond directly to it, there seems little reason to doubt its fundamental authenticity.<br /><br />
