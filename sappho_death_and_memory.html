        <h1>Sappho, Death, and Memory</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p><span style="font-style:italic">Translations of and about Sappho</span><br /><br />
            When Solon the Athenian, son of Execestides, heard his nephew sing a song of Sappho along with the wine, he liked it and told the child to teach it to him. When someone asked for what reason he was so eager, he said “so that, having learned it, I might die.”<sup>[1]</sup><br /><br />

            <div class="origPub"><p>These translations were originally posted to this website on April 9th, 2018, for National Poetry Month.<br /><br />
              <sup>[1]</sup> This prose passage, attributed to Aelian, comes from Stobaeus' <span style="font-style:italic">Anthology</span> (taken here from the Loeb volume):<br /><br />
              <span class="indent" style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">Σόλων ὁ Ἀθηναῖος ὁ Ἐξηκεστίδου παρὰ πότον τοῦ ἀδελφιδοῦ αὐτοῦ μέλος τι Σαπφοῦς ᾄσαντος ἥσθη τῷ μέλει καὶ προσέταξε τῷ μειρακίῳ διδάξαι αὐτόν· ἐρωτήσαντος δέ τινος διὰ ποίαν αἰτίαν τοῦτο ἐσπούδασεν, ὁ δὲ ἔφη, ἵνα μαθὼν αὐτὸ ἀποθάνω.</span><br /><br />
              Full disclosure, though, I had no idea how to render <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">διὰ ποίαν αἰτίαν</span>. Regardless, I thought it would make for a pleasant opening.<br /><br />
              <sup>[2]</sup> This passage is Sappho fragment 55 according to the Lobel-Page numbering. It survives partially quoted in Plutarch's <span style="font-style:italic">Moralia</span> and more completely, again, in Stobaeus' <span style="font-style:italic">Anthology</span>. It is prefaced with <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">Σαπφοῦς πρὸς ἀπαίδευτον γυναῖκα</span>, "of Sappho to an uneducated woman." Here is the Loeb version:<br /><br />
              <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">κατθάνοισα δὲ κείσῃ οὐδέ ποτα μναμοσύνα σέθεν<br />
              ἔσσετ᾿ οὐδὲ πόθα εἰς ὔστερον· οὐ γὰρ πεδέχῃς βρόδων<br />
              τὼν ἐκ Πιερίας, ἀλλ᾿ ἀφάνης κἀν Ἀίδα δόμῳ<br />
              φοιτάσῃς πεδ᾿ ἀμαύρων νεκύων ἐκπεποταμένα.</span><br /><br />
              The meter seems somewhat corrupt. However, given that it is quoted in two different sources at different lengths, and that the following epigram seems to respond directly to it, there seems little reason to doubt its fundamental authenticity.<br /><br />
              <sup>[3]</sup> This passage, meanwhile, can be called inauthentic with little trouble. The text supposes itself to be the inscription on Sappho's tomb in Mytilene (i.e. Lesbos). Sappho, of course, likely died in exile. Moreover, the general form of the epigram makes clear reference to the one quoted earlier by Stobaeus, suggesting that a later poet, knowing Sappho's insult to the uneducated woman, decided to compose a fanciful epitaph in her style. The text itself, I suppose, makes no claim that it is actually authentic or a quotation; indeed, it may have been explictly an exercise. However, I have seen the text attributed to Sappho herself on several occassions, so it doesn't hurt to clear things up. The text comes from Tullius Laurea's <span style="font-style:italic">On the Same</span>, quoted in the Loeb from the <span style="font-style:italic">Palatine Anthology</span>:<br /><br />
              <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">Αἰολικὸν παρὰ τύμβον ἰών, ξένε, μή με θανοῦσαν</span><br />
              <span style="padding-left:1em;font-family:'EB Garamond'">τὰν Μιτυληναίαν ἔννεπ᾿ ἀοιδοπόλον·</span><br />
              <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">τόνδε γὰρ ἀνθρώπων ἔκαμον χέρες, ἔργα δὲ φωτῶν</span><br />
              <span style="padding-left:1em;font-family:'EB Garamond'">ἐς ταχινὴν ἔρρει τοιάδε ληθεδόνα·</span><br />
              <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">ἢ δέ με Μουσάων ἐτάσῃς χάριν, ὧν ἀφ᾿ ἑκάστης</span><br />
              <span style="padding-left:1em;font-family:'EB Garamond'">δαίμονος ἄνθος ἐμῇ θῆκα παρ᾿ ἐννεάδι,</span><br />
              <span style="font-family:'EB Garamond'">γνώσεαι ὡς Ἀίδεω σκότον ἔκφυγον, οὐδέ τις ἔσται</span><br />
              <span style="padding-left:1em;font-family:'EB Garamond'">τῆς λυρικῆς Σαπφοῦς νώνυμος ἠέλιος.</span><br /><br />
