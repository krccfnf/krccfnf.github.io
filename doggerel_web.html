            We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:2.5em">All art is quite useless.</span><br />
            <span style="padding-left:5em">— Oscar Wilde, from the preface of <span style="font-style:italic">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span></span><br /><br />
            Art is useless because its aim is simply to create a mood. It is not meant to instruct or influence action in any way. It is superbly sterile, and the note of its pleasure is sterility.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:5em">— Wilde’s response when Bernulf Clegg asked him to expound on the former statement</span><br /><br />
            “The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”<br />
            <span style="padding-left:5em">— Lord Henry, in Oscar Wilde’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span></span><br /><br />

            A poet dies in me—<br />
            (as Nero must have thought).<br />
            So little time to be<br />
            an emperor and god.<br /><br />
            Though a god I never was,<br />
            nor emperor, oh no—<br />
            the gods all live above<br />
            where mortals cannot go—<br /><br />
            and kings can rule their days—<br />
            though days are short in Rome,<br />
            ‘til you’re damned and erased,<br />
            your pictures scrubbed from home.<br /><br />
            <span style="font-style:italic">Damnatio</span>, the senate cries!<br />
            <span style="font-style:italic">Qualis artifex pereo</span>—<br />
            farewell to me<br />
            and all my lies.<br /> </p>
