            We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">All art is quite useless.</span><br />
            <span style="padding-left:3em">— Oscar Wilde, from the preface of <span style="font-style:italic">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span></span><br /><br />
            Art is useless because its aim is simply to create a mood. It is not meant to instruct or influence action in any way. It is superbly sterile, and the note of its pleasure is sterility.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:3em">— Wilde’s response when Bernulf Clegg asked him to expound on the former statement</span><br /><br />
            “The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”<br />
            <span style="padding-left:3em">— Lord Henry, in Oscar Wilde’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span></span><br /><br />

            A poet dies in me—<br />
            (as Nero must have thought).<br />
            So little time to be<br />
            an emperor and god.<br /><br />
            Though a god I never was,<br />
            nor emperor, oh no—<br />
            the gods all live above<br />
            where mortals cannot go—<br /><br />
            and kings can rule their days—<br />
            though days are short in Rome,<br />
            ‘til you’re damned and erased,<br />
            your pictures scrubbed from home.<br /><br />
            <span style="font-style:italic">Damnatio</span>, the senate cries!<br />
            <span style="font-style:italic">Qualis artifex pereo</span>—<br />
            farewell to me<br />
            and all my lies.<br /></p>

            we were springtime,<br />
            <span style="padding-left:9em">verdant, vernal,<br />
            awash in light<br />
            <span style="padding-left:7em">I thought eternal;<br />
            but now my heart<br />
            <span style="padding-left:8em">is cold and stone,<br />
            grown o’er with moss<br />
            <span style="padding-left:11em">and weathered down.<br /><br /><br />
            we soared aloft<br />
            <span style="padding-left:7em">through cloudy heights,<br />
            though soon to crash<br />
            <span style="padding-left:10em">like Phaethon’s flight.<br />
            and yet I long<br />
            <span style="padding-left:7em">to fall again,<br />
            and if to fall<br />
            <span style="padding-left:6em">to meet my end.<br />

            I lavish much encomium<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">upon beguiling eyes</span><br />
            (though never will you hear me speak<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">and tell my pretty lies).</span><br /><br />
            But are they lies?<br />
            <span style="padding-left:8em">Perhaps they aren’t—</span><br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">I’m sure we’ll never know,</span><br />
            for you will never look my way<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">for I am far below.</span><br /><br /><br />
            ii.<br /><br />
            I long for vanity in love<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">(indeed, perhaps, <span style="font-style:italic">hevel</span>)—</span><br />
            the cruel look, the brutal voice,<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">as fleeting as the swell.</span><br /><br /><br />
            iii.<br /><br />
            But you who stand so quizzical,<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">whose eyes I once heard laugh:</span><br />
            come smile at once, and with your grin<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">now write my epitaph.</span><br /><br /><br />
            iv.<br /><br />
            I know you know much more than me<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">(and so I am afraid).</span><br />
            For often do I love a face<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">before I love a brain.</span><br /><br /><br />
            v.<br /><br />
            And, too, I never love someone<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">until I’ve wrote a verse</span><br />
            that takes their eyes and calls them gems<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">(though emeralds are a first).</span><br /><br />
            But now I’ve done it all again<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">(my heart is on my tongue);</span><br />
            forgive this verse, so saccharine<br />
            <span style="padding-left:1.5em">(but recall that we are young!).</span><br />

            Would Eve have shared a bitter fruit?<br />
            I rather doubt she would have done—<br />
            for death must never have a bitter taste:<br />
            indeed, the curse of sin is sweet and cold<br />
            and whispers growth—not waste.<br /><br />

            a soul that burned with sin beneath their breast,<br />
            a stone that stung like ice<br />
            <span style="padding-left:3em">and never knew rest.</span><br /><br />
            But pain was sweet<br />
            <span style="padding-left:3em">(and sweet still is)</span><br />
            and sin a plum<br />

            some poems that didn’t make the cut:
              <ul><li>a Wisconsin-themed parody of Marlowe’s “Passionate Shepherd,” except most of it was about Culver’s</li>
                <li>a poem that, without knowledge of the Shakespearean pun on “dying,” would sound like the confession of a serial killer</li>
                <li>a really melodramatic poem about being dumped that relied entirely on the imagery of <span style="font-style:italic">King Lear Act II</span></li>
                <li>a whole slew of ballads and sonnets that are far too erotic to print</li>
                <li>more pieces to “christmas funeral” and “sweet”</li>
                <li>a poem about a “summer child” that I wrote entirely ignorant of what it meant in <span style="font-style:italic">Game of Thrones</span></li>
                <li>a terrible piece in tetrameter couplets about Orpheus that ended with the exceptionally good couplet of “Forgive me please, Eurydice / for hell has closed its gates to me.”</li>
                <li>the same as the last, except from a poem on the flight of Daphne: “So Daphne fell to littered leaves / and still today Apollo grieves.”</li>
                <li>anything written with any semblance of seriousness (except for “christmas funeral”—I couldn’t help but be serious there)</li>
                <li>an erotic elegy written after Marlowe with such beautiful Marlovian lines as “books full bound in hide”</li>
                <li>a pleasant but utterly forgettable poem that very obviously borrowed from Milton’s “pendant world” description of earth</li>
                <li>a sonnet/suicide note where each quatrain described circles of Dante’s hell I thought my soul would be appropriate for</li>
                <li>literally 95% of anything I’ve ever written; that’s right, all this was somehow the best I could muster</li></ul?
