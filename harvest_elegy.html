        <h1>Harvest Elegy</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>The farmer shall not plant this field again;
            his scythe has mowed the wheat a final time.
            His children’s hands have gathered all the fruit
            and set a feast inside, though in the field
            they let some fall across the furrowed ground
            (if not for Ruth, for birds to gather up
            and raise the crop unto the endless sky).
            The barn is bursting with the hay; the bails
            now crowd the rafters, old but standing yet
            to hold the final harvest from the field.
            The oxen rest their shoulders from the plow;
            they shall not till the lot again come spring.
            The farmer, now, has left his sickle lay:
            no longer shall he sift or winnow, thresh,
            or burn the chaff; now he, and th’earth, shall rest
            from toil.
            <span style="padding-left:5.5em">The autumn air has chilled the ground</span>
            and left it empty for the hungry snow.
            The field is flat, each stalk at harvest cut
            to gather into sheaves, and so it sprawls
            out bare.
            <span style="padding-left:5em">But though the field is empty now,</span>
            it soon with grass will sway;
            it soon with bees
            will hum (and every tree around will run
            with honey sweet as if they dripped with myrrh);
            and soon with flowers all will bloom;
            <span style="padding-left:13em">the trees</span>
            will spring to life, and horses then will graze
            and gnaw at tender leaves and lounge beneath
            the vernal shade;
            <span style="padding-left:8em">and soon will birds begin</span>
            to flock and fill the place with endless song
            (and someday might a poet sit and muse
            to all the singing, sweet and ever long);
            and, too, forgotten seeds shall spring anew—
            the wheat, dim gold, will sway with gentle breeze,
            and all the earth shall with it wave, a sea
            of moving, living fruit and gilded feed.<br /><br />
	          <span style="padding-left:2em">Two farmers, now, have taken up their grain;</span>
	          <span style="padding-left:2em">what earth has lost has heaven ever gained.</span></p>
