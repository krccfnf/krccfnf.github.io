        <h1>Harvest Elegy</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>The farmer shall not plant this field again;<br />
            his scythe has mowed the wheat a final time.<br />
            His children’s hands have gathered all the fruit<br />
            and set a feast inside, though in the field<br />
            they let some fall across the furrowed ground<br />
            (if not for Ruth, for birds to gather up<br />
            and raise the crop unto the endless sky).<br />
            The barn is bursting with the hay; the bails<br />
            now crowd the rafters, old but standing yet<br />
            to hold the final harvest from the field.<br />
            The oxen rest their shoulders from the plow;<br />
            they shall not till the lot again come spring.<br />
            The farmer, now, has left his sickle lay:<br />
            no longer shall he sift or winnow, thresh,<br />
            or burn the chaff; now he, and th’earth, shall rest<br />
            from toil.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:4.1em">The autumn air has chilled the ground</span><br />
            and left it empty for the hungry snow.<br />
            The field is flat, each stalk at harvest cut<br />
            to gather into sheaves, and so it sprawls<br />
            out bare.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:4em">But though the field is empty now,</span><br />
            it soon with grass will sway;<br />
            <span style="padding-left:11.5em">it soon with bees<br />
            will hum (and every tree around will run<br />
            with honey sweet as if they dripped with myrrh);<br />
            and soon with flowers all will bloom;<br />
            <span style="padding-left:15em">the trees</span><br />
            will spring to life, and horses then will graze<br />
            and gnaw at tender leaves and lounge beneath<br />
            the vernal shade;<br />
            <span style="padding-left:7.2em">and soon will birds begin</span><br />
            to flock and fill the place with endless song<br />
            (and someday might a poet sit and muse<br />
            to all the singing, sweet and ever long);<br />
            and, too, forgotten seeds shall spring anew—<br />
            the wheat, dim gold, will sway with gentle breeze,<br />
            and all the earth shall with it wave, a sea<br />
            of moving, living fruit and gilded feed.<br /><br />
	    <span style="padding-left:2em">Two farmers, now, have taken up their grain;</span><br />
	    <span style="padding-left:2em">what earth has lost has heaven ever gained.</span></p>
