        <h1>alcibiades</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>just last night he had dreamed<br />
            he was in my paint, my clothes;<br />
            now here in my arms, wounded,<br />
            my veil a winding sheet, made<br />
            up in my colors and his blood<br />
            as if ready to sit down to dinner.<br />
            the arrows reside in him yet,<br />
            plunged deep, achieving in day<br />
            what i could only find at night,<br />
            when quietly he would come<br />
            or i would, and he’d tell me<br />
            what socrates had taught him<br />
            ages ago, imperious and older.<br />
            sometimes he’d quote the verse<br />
            his old classmate wrote, how<br />
            his soul—wretched and trying<br />
            to be steadfast—would still<br />
            nearly cross over to his lover<br />
            when they embraced, their lips<br />
            a bridge, explaining, perhaps,<br />
            why he didn’t much like to kiss.<br />
            that i might take his soul that way.<br />
            i could only nod, understanding<br />
            there was, no more, a chance<br />
            to analyze the good or the bad,<br />
            alien to me and my formation,<br />
            late to having the courage<br />
            to love men (really, to hate men).<br />
            and, after, he would leave<br />
            fare on the nightstand, obols<br />
            i still carry in my mouth.<br />
            his blood had the same taste.</p><!-- GOTTA ADD THE QUOTATIONS -->
