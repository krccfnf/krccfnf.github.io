        <h1>alcibiades</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>just last night he had dreamed<br />
            he was in my paint, my clothes;<br />
            now here in my arms, wounded,<br />
            my veil a winding sheet, made<br />
            up in my colors and his blood<br />
            as if ready to sit down to dinner.<br />
            the arrows reside in him yet,<br />
            plunged deep, achieving in day<br />
            what i could only find at night,<br />
            when quietly he would come<br />
            or i would, and he’d tell me<br />
            what socrates had taught him<br />
            ages ago, imperious and older.<br />
            sometimes he’d quote the verse<br />
            his old classmate wrote, how<br />
            his soul—wretched and trying<br />
            to be steadfast—would still<br />
            nearly cross over to his lover<br />
            when they embraced, their lips<br />
            a bridge, explaining, perhaps,<br />
            why he didn’t much like to kiss.<br />
            that i might take his soul that way.<br />
            i could only nod, understanding<br />
            there was, no more, a chance<br />
            to analyze the good or the bad,<br />
            alien to me and my formation,<br />
            late to having the courage<br />
            to love men (really, to hate men).<br />
            and, after, he would leave<br />
            fare on the nightstand, obols<br />
            i still carry in my mouth.<br />
            his blood had the same taste.<br /><br /><br />
            <span style="margin-left:2em"><span style="font-style:italic">My soul, when I was kissing Agathon, I bore upon my lips;<br />
            <span style="margin-left:2em">it came—the wretched, steadfast thing—as if to take itself across.</span></span><br /><br />
            <span style="margin-left:4em">— <span style="font-style:italic">Greek Anthology</span> 5.78, attributed (probably falsely) to Plato</span><br /><br /><br />
            <span style="display:inline-block;margin-left:2em"><span style="font-style:italic">…Alcibiades had the courtesan Timandra with him, and in his sleep he saw this vision: he thought he was wearing the courtesan’s clothes while she held his head in the crook of her arm and prepared his face like a woman, painting and outlining. […] All say that he had a vision not long before his death. […] They cast upon him javelins and arrows, and so he fell. […] Timandra took up his corpse and wrapped it and covered it in her clothes…</span></span><br /><br />

            <div class="origPub"><p>Originally published (in a slightly different form) in the second annual <a href="https://www.instagram.com/poetry4cowards">Open Mic Surgery</a> anthology, a lovely poetry open mic held at <a href="https://neverendingbooks.net/">Never Ending Books</a>. The poem was included in an exhibition at the launch of the book and featured two papyri (which I really just displayed for the hell of it, though it was nice to add some ancient materiality to the piece). They represented the Greek texts of the two quotations, written in an uncial hand. Pseudo-Plato was presented in a clean hand on fresh papyrus, resembling how such a manuscript would have looked at its creation. The second papyrus was presented in a state similar to how an ancient document might be recovered today: damaged, discolored, and fragmentary. The artificial damage served the creative project well—as the quotation was condensed in several places, I was able to knock out the irrelevant text via fragmentation in the papyrus. Were a papyrologist to reconstruct the full column using the complete text, the surviving portions would be those highlighted in green here.</p></div>
