      <h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
        <p>If you are interested in submitting a literary analysis or creative writing piece, please send all necessary materials (cover sheet, submission, etc.) to <a href="mailto:museuw@gmail.com">museuw@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Literati 2018 Submission." The submission deadline for University of Wisconsin—Madison students has been extended to <span style="font-weight:bold">11:59pm CT on February 1st, 2018</span>. Acceptance or rejection for national submissions will be communicated by January 21st, 2018 (note that this means that decisions will be sent, at the latest, six weeks before the conference for national students); decisions for University of Wisconsin—Madison students will be sent in the weeks after February 1st. All documents should be submitted in .doc, .docx, or .rtf format. Literati is intended for those currently enrolled in an undergraduate program; if you will graduate before the date of the conference, you are ineligible to submit. Finally, the piece should be relevant to our <a href="https://matthewstokdyk.com/literati_archive_about#Theme">theme of Transformations</a>.</p>

            <ul><li>While there is no strict length requirement, successful papers are usually between 7-15 (double-spaced) pages. Presenters are allotted fifteen minutes to present their argument during the conference; thus, we recommend determining an appropriate paper length in terms of how much information is necessary to compellingly<!-- "effectively"? --> present your thesis in fifteen minutes.</li>
              <li>All submissions must use a standard academic citation style (e.g. Chicago, MLA, APA) and must cite all sources, primary and secondary, used.</li>
              <li>Any necessary additional materials, including appendices, primary texts (suggested if the piece is a lesser-known public domain work), or images should be included either at the end of your submission or as a separate file.</li>
              <li>Submissions may be about works in languages other than English, but the primary language of the paper must be English. Translations for quotations should be provided where necessary.</li></ul>

            <ul><li>The recommended maximum length for prose pieces is 15 (double-spaced) pages. Presenters will have fifteen minutes to present their piece, and this time limit should be considered when deciding the length of the piece.</li>
