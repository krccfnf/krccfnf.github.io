        <h1>A Spell</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>i, 11/9/2016<br /><br />
            A quiet day on campus mall,<br />
            and only white men smile—<br />
            my head is bowed, my back is bent<br />
            along this silent mile.<br /><br />
            I study hard the pavement’s grain,<br />
            my eyes I cannot raise.<br />
            And as I walk this endless track<br />
            I meet a hateful gaze.<br /><br />
            He looks at me with sneering eyes<br />
            beneath a brim of red—<br />
            and though I’m sure he called me all,<br />
            I heard no words he said.<br /><br />
            I raised my face and looked at him<br />
            without an ounce of ire—<br />
            and on I walked along the path,<br />
            untouched by tongues of fire.<br /><br />
            And on we walk, with heads held high,<br />
            without a pang of shame—<br />
            and though we fear this chilly fall,<br />
            the world will know our names.<br /><br /><br />
            ii, 3/9/2017<br /><br />
            an oval room that’s now bedecked in amber<br />
            <span style="padding-left:2em">(fair Catherine’s greatest treasure),</span><br />
            once plundered by a fascist hand<br />
            <span style="padding-left:2em">(and plundered still, perhaps);</span><br />
            hail comrade, hail—<br />
            someone ought to tell Trumbo<br />
            that McCarthy failed.<br /><br />
            a bust of Churchill sitting there<br />
            and watching on<br /><br />
            the oilman holds our Mother by the nape<br />
            <span style="padding-left:2em">(can you see her flowing tears?)</span><br />
            and though we cry against the rape<br />
            the money stuffs the oilman’s ears<br /><br />
            as each order is turned to the placid cameramen<br />
            standing silent all around<br />
            documenting the feeble hand<br />
            sunk in pockets<br />
            that sag to the sulfured ground.<br /><br />
            <span style="padding-left:2em;font-style:italic">The April rains, through stormy strife,</span><br />
            <span style="padding-left:2em;font-style:italic">come here to give the flowers life;</span><br /><br />
            and would that art not wilt<br />
            (if it ever truly bloomed?)<br />
            before the butcher’s hand<br />
            when paint from cuts is spilt<br />
            words penned for doom<br />
            by a shaking hand<br /><br />
            <span style="padding-left:2em;font-style:italic">but underneath this fatal reign</span><br />
            <span style="padding-left:4em;font-style:italic">and greying skies</span><br />
            <span style="padding-left:2em;font-style:italic">it seems our hopes will flower up</span><br />
            <span style="padding-left:4em;font-style:italic">if but to die</span><br /><br />
            Churchill didn’t really say<br />
            the cause of defense was art;<br />
            so his face offers only a disapproving glance.<br /><br />
            so let us say it;<br />
            we might never have another chance.</p>
