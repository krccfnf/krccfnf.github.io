        <h1>prescription</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>Not knowing where else to keep them<br />
            I hid the sedatives beside my bed<br />
            after I had taken them from you<br />
            because you refused to stop taking them<br />
            and you got so fucking high<br />
            and I had to drive your car when we went out<br />
            first picking up B who wondered<br />
            why I was driving as you stumbled from the door<br />
            zombiewalked around to fill us with gas<br />
            glassy eyes glazed set in the kiln<br />
            that never stopped burning.<br /><br />
            You never asked for them back<br />
            likely because you had no memory<br />
            of surrendering them or even taking them;<br />
            two years later you didnâ€™t even remember the car.<br /><br />
            Until recently they remained there<br />
            beside a coin collection and old wallets<br />
            long stripped of their money.<br /><br />
            But the day my cat crawled inside<br />
            I knew I had to flush them<br /><br />
            because what tranquilizes a horse<br />
            will kill a cat<br />
            (and maybe something more).</p>
            <div class="origPub"><p>One of five poems originally published in <span style="font-style:italic">Anatomy of Our Nightstands</span>, a zine curated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yusiiiiliu/" class="plainLink">by Yusi Liu</a> for <a href="https://www.littlebookwi.com/place-spaces-edition-3" class="plainLink">the Spring 2021 edition of the Little Book Project in Madison.</a> You will note some recurrent themes in the poems, chiefly angst (originating with me) and certain motifs picked up from a 2018 exhibition Yusi held in her home in Madison. It examined, in part, the functions of and associations between domestic spaces and objects (including the impetus for the Little Book: what one might keep in a nightstand that one keeps nowhere else, like contraception, drugs, personal effects, purely utilitarian objects, etc.).</p></div>
