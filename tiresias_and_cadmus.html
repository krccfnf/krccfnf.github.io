        <h1>Tiresias and Cadmus</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>at his dusk,<br />
            Tiresias trod through Theban wood<br />
            unled save by auspice<br />
            and long memories of long walks<br /><br />
            when then a noise<br />
            a rustling midst the leaf piles<br />
            of scales gliding<br />
            against the scraped ground<br /><br />
            turning sharp ears<br />
            he stooped and shook the earth<br />
            to find two snakes<br />
            making love beneath the trees<br /><br />
            when then his heart<br />
            fluttered, remembering airy days<br />
            as a woman.<br />
            and he longed for nine parts of ten<br /><br />
            once more—once more<br />
            he thought to tap against the scales<br />
            feel the release<br />
            of orgastic womanhood at the strike of a rod.<br /><br />
            seven lifetimes<br />
            and nothing compared, but,<br />
            through cruel fate,<br />
            he had never found another pair<br /><br />
            of fucking snakes.<br />
            so raising up his walking stick<br />
            he went to hit<br />
            but in his frailty merely bruised<br /><br />
            the target,<br />
            who screamed “old friend!<br />
            how I’ve missed you!”<br />
            blind eyes widening—<br /><br />
            “Cadmus?”<br />
            “We glide on to Elysium<br />
            at last.”<br />
            “I’m sorry to keep you, then.”<br /><br />
            “Be careful,<br />
            old man, that the next serpent<br />
            not sow<br />
            its teeth in your furrows.”<br /><br />
            and Cadmus,<br />
            old money, older man, slithered on,<br />
            wife in tow,<br />
            leaving Tiresias again—alone.<br /></p>
