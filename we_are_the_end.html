        <h1>we are the end</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>We are the end.<br />
            We said goodbye at the Gethsemane drive-in<br />
            (and you didn’t even give me a kiss).<br />
            <span style="padding-left:4em;font-style:italic">You’re too cold to study Latin.</span><br />
            You had always kept me grounded, held down<br />
            like Isaac on the pyre. Bind me again,<br />
            touch my eyes with your tongue and make me see.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:4em;font-style:italic">You’re too cold for this town.</span><br />
            And I was Samson, pillared (but too weak)<br />
            and struck by blinding lights<br />
            from the police cruiser rammed up behind us.<br />
            <span style="padding-left:4em;font-style:italic">You’re too cold for me.</span><br />
            And I’d see God when I learned Greek,<br />
            and remember that day in winter, with the vase of Ajax,<br />
            when you called before class, before the funeral,<br />
            <span style="padding-left:4em">to keep you from death.</span></p>
