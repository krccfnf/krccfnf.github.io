        <h1>Erotic Haiku</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">1</span><br /><br />
            fresh bamboo<br />
            flexing in my grip;<br />
            rain shower.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">2</span><br /><br />
            spring petals—<br />
            pliable in my hand,<br />
            wet with dew.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">3</span><br /><br />
            long days<br />
            straining in heat;<br />
            cicada wails.</p>
            <div class="origPub"><p>These were originally never intended for public consumption; however, at the June 18th, 2024 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/poetry4cowards">Open Mic Surgery</a> at <a href="https://neverendingbooks.net/">Never Ending Books,</a> I was inspired to read the first haiku because someone else had read one and because of a certain topic of conversation we had all been entertaining. I would have let the haiku simply disappear into the ether, but a journalist happened to be there <a href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/article/open_mic_surgery_opens_up_the_community">who quoted the first one in the article she wrote about the open mic.</a> The first line was quoted incorrectly (“brash” instead of “fresh”), but I honestly quite like the misquote.<br /><br />I read the second haiku after the first, as they are nearly identical—typical bisexual indecision left me unable to choose which way to use the image, so I made two versions. The third I did not read but am posting here.<br /><br />You will note that these poems do not follow a 5-7-5 syllable structure. I had initially tried doing them with a 5-7-5 morae structure, but I was informed by a linguist that that was perhaps phonologically impossible to do in English. So, in the end, they are haiku primarily based on vibes.</p></div>
