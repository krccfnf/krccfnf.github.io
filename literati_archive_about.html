      <h1>About Literati</h1>
      <p>Literati is one of the largest undergraduate English conferences in the nation, hosted annually at the University of Wisconsin—Madison by the Madison Undergraduate Society for English. For the sixth year, undergraduate presenters from around the country will gather to present original literary analyses and creative writings to their peers, family, and faculty at the University of Wisconsin—Madison; the conference will be held on <span style="font-weight:bold">March 10th, 2018</span> from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm at Union South. To submit a piece to the conference, please see <a href="http://matthewstokdyk.com/literati_archive_submit">this page</a>.<br />
        <h2>Theme</h2>
          <p>This year, the conference theme is <span style="font-weight:bold">Transformations</span>. A theme of Transformations invites readers and writers to explore a variety of questions, including (but certainly not limited to): how does the experience of literature change the individual? How does it change the world? How does a transformation within a text—of character, of narrative perspective, of writing style—translate into meaningful experience for the reader? If you have written a literary analysis or creative work (including prose, poetry, and hybrids of the two) that focuses on themes of transformation, change, or metamorphosis, we encourage you to <a href="http://matthewstokdyk.com/literati_archive_submit">submit to the conference</a>.</p>
        <h2>Conference Events</h2>
          <p>The conference will feature an opening keynote address from University of Wisconsin—Madison professor, poet, and author <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/quan-barry">Quan Barry</a>. Throughout the day, the conference will entail nine two-person presentation panels (with three occurring concurrently during each panel hour) grouped by the content of the papers presented. Each presenter will give a twenty minute presentation of their argument or creative work; after the conclusion of all three presentations, a question-and-answer session will be held for fifteen minutes, moderated by a MUSE executive team member, allowing the audience to ask questions of individual presenters or to ask questions that put multiple presentations in conversation with one another. Lunch will be provided for participants between sessions. The day will conclude with a networking hour.</p>
        <h2>What is MUSE?</h2>
          <p>MUSE is the Madison Undergraduate Society for English, a pre-professional fellowship of English majors at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. MUSE seeks to connect English undergraduates with English graduate students, professors, and professionals. MUSE also seeks to highlight the multitude of career opportunities available to English majors while helping to connect them to professionals in their fields as well as English department and MUSE alumni who have pursued English-related work. The society established and continues to organize the Literati conference.</p>
