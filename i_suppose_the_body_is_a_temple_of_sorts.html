        <h1>i suppose the body is a temple (of sorts)</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>his body was doric—<br />
            sturdy, substantial;<br />
            but his soul—<br />
            absolutely corinthian.<br />
            and a head, replete<br />
            and plated in delicate<br />
            ionic curls, supporting<br />
            the weight of lofty thoughts.<br />
            and etched into his back<br />
            triglyphs from chisel claws,<br />
            dentals pressed into his neck<br />
            from an architect<br />
            perched on a tall column<br />
            (unfluted, mind you)<br />
            made of royal porphyry.</p>
