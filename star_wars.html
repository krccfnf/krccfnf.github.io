        <h1>star wars</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <div class="hanging-mid"><p>we stopped talking before i could fulfill the order you had placed,<br /></p>
            <p>an erotic star wars story, which, as you explained your vision,<br /></p>
            <p>was very obviously meant to be a thinly veiled fantasy about us,<br /></p>
            <p>in which i was obi-wan kenobi and you were anakin skywalker,<br /></p>
            <p>my padawan (though i was affronted by the implication<br /></p>
            <p>of some power imbalance or pedagogical element, you older than i—<br /></p>
            <p>indeed, already a full knight—and never, surely never one of us<br />
            <p>instructing the other in anything but how to twist the knife).<br />
            <p>they (we) were to go on some new adventure on a planet non-descript<br /></p>
            <p>(dealer’s choice, but we knew it would end up on coruscant—<br /></p>
            <p>i wanted as many people around as possible when we were out,<br /></p>
            <p>even in fiction) and then they would, of course, fuck.<br /></p>
            <p>this must have been a truly burning desire, to willingly cast yourself<br /></p>
            <p>as a jedi, because whenever the standard question of<br /></p>
            <p>“what would you want your life to be in the star wars universe”<br /></p>
            <p>came up, you always said “a droid,” an honest and absurd answer<br /></p>
            <p>when you could be a jedi or pilot or bounty hunter or anything<br /></p>
            <p>but the silly little astromech that you knew you were inside<br /></p>
            <p>(indeed, were we not R2-D2 and C-3PO, my incessant worrying<br /></p>
            <p>and annoying politeness, deference, fear, your abrasive comments hidden<br /></p>
            <p>behind beeps and boops only i could understand?). at the very least<br /></p>
            <p>it was in-character to cast yourself as the chosen one.<br /></p>
            <p>i asked if you wanted anakin genderbent to more accurately match<br /></p>
            <p>our dynamic, but you said making it as gay as possible was ideal,<br /></p>
            <p>or, if anything, to genderbend obi-wan, and i could not disagree.<br /></p>
            <p>besides, like anakin, you said, you cried more than i did,<br /></p>
            <p>and i had to be obi-wan because you read in a novel that qui-gon<br /></p>
            <p>made him learn a bunch of dead languages. it’s all so funny<br /></p>
            <p>that it ended this way, with forgotten writing. we met because<br /></p>
            <p>you liked my writing—no, not the smut that i had started<br /></p>
            <p>posting a few months before we met, which you did eventually read,<br /></p>
            <p>prompting this request of me, among so many other things<br /></p>
            <p>far exceeding words—but instead pithy, cruel nonsense<br /></p>
            <p>i had written on reddit, mocking the inaccuracies<br /></p>
            <p>of a linguistics article written by some poor freelancer,<br /></p>
            <p>which moved you, inexplicably, to dm me and say that<br /></p>
            <p>you liked how i wrote. i’m glad it was that post and not<br /></p>
            <p>the erotica; i never would have given real thought<br /></p>
            <p>to someone who messaged me there, even if, occasionally,<br /></p>
            <p>the unrequested genitals they showed me were intriguing.<br /></p>
            <p>the failure to finish this story for you was not the first instance<br /></p>
            <p>my lack of words had disappointed—you asked me<br /></p>
            <p>to write another linguistics post for your birthday, and i<br /></p>
            <p>did not. our story arced like the movies, first with a betrayal<br /></p>
            <p>(in your view), me leaving you burning in lava but unable<br /></p>
            <p>to finish the job, neither out of pity nor of malice but out of love<br /></p>
            <p>and hate, unable to reignite my saber, let the energy flow<br /></p>
            <p>through the kyber, cut you loose at last in a flurry of blue plasma,<br /></p>
            <p>instead content to watch you burn before me, until finally your rage<br /></p>
            <p>and hate overcame you. and then we would reunite years later, you<br /></p>
            <p>more powerful than ever and i living in exile in the desert, soon<br /></p>
            <p>reduced to nothing with a single stroke of your blade.</p></div>
            <div class="origPub"><p>A horribly maximalist poem originally published in the second annual <a href="https://www.instagram.com/poetry4cowards">Open Mic Surgery</a> anthology, a lovely poetry open mic held at <a href="https://neverendingbooks.net/">Never Ending Books</a>. The poem was included in an exhibition at the launch of the book. Reading it is meant to be as exhausting as the relationship was, but I do not know if that really makes for good poetry in the end.</p></div><!-- CHANGE INITIAL VIEWPORT -->
