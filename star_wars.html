        <h1>star wars</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p style="padding-left:16vw;text-indent:-8vw">we stopped talking before i could fulfill the order you had placed,<br /></p>
            <p style="text-indent:-22px">an erotic star wars story, which, as you explained your vision,<br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left:22px;text-indent:-22px;padding-top:0vw;padding-bottom:0vw">was very obviously meant to be a thinly veiled fantasy about us,<br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left:22px;text-indent:-22px;padding-top:0vw;padding-bottom:0vw">in which i was obi-wan kenobi and you were anakin skywalker,<br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left:22px;text-indent:-22px;padding-top:0vw;padding-bottom:0vw">my padawan (though i was affronted by the implication<br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left:22px;text-indent:-22px">of some power imbalance or pedagogical element, you older than i—<br /></p>
            <p>indeed, already a full knight—and never, surely never one of us<br />
            instructing the other in anything but how to twist the knife).<br />
            they (we) were to go on some new adventure on a planet non-descript<br /></p>
            (dealer’s choice, but we knew it would end up on coruscant—<br />
            i wanted as many people around as possible when we were out,<br />
            even in fiction) and then they would, of course, fuck.<br />
            this must have been a truly burning desire, to willingly cast yourself<br />
            as a jedi, because whenever the standard question of<br />
            “what would you want your life to be in the star wars universe”<br />
            came up, you always said “a droid,” an honest and absurd answer<br />
            when you could be a jedi or pilot or bounty hunter or anything<br />
            but the silly little astromech that you knew you were inside<br />
            (indeed, were we not R2-D2 and C-3PO, my incessant worrying<br />
            and annoying politeness, deference, fear, your abrasive comments hidden<br />
            behind beeps and boops only i could understand?). at the very least<br />
            it was in-character to cast yourself as the chosen one.<br />
            i asked if you wanted anakin genderbent to more accurately match<br />
            our dynamic, but you said making it as gay as possible was ideal,<br />
            or, if anything, to genderbend obi-wan, and i could not disagree.<br />
            besides, like anakin, you said, you cried more than i did,<br />
            and i had to be obi-wan because you read in a novel that qui-gon<br />
            made him learn a bunch of dead languages. it’s all so funny<br />
            that it ended this way, with forgotten writing. we met because<br />
            you liked my writing—no, not the smut that i had started<br />
            posting a few months before we met, which you did eventually read,<br />
            prompting this request of me, among so many other things<br />
            far exceeding words—but instead pithy, cruel nonsense<br />
            i had written on reddit, mocking the inaccuracies<br />
            of a linguistics article written by some poor freelancer,<br />
            which moved you, inexplicably, to dm me and say that<br />
            you liked how i wrote. i’m glad it was that post and not<br />
            the erotica; i never would have given real thought<br />
            to someone who messaged me there, even if, occasionally,<br />
            the unrequested genitals they showed me were intriguing.<br />
            the failure to finish this story for you was not the first instance<br />
            my lack of words had disappointed—you asked me<br />
            to write another linguistics post for your birthday, and i<br />
            did not. our story arced like the movies, first with a betrayal<br />
            (in your view), me leaving you burning in lava but unable<br />
            to finish the job, neither out of pity nor of malice but out of love<br />
            and hate, unable to reignite my saber, let the energy flow<br />
            through the kyber, cut you loose at last in a flurry of blue plasma,<br />
            instead content to watch you burn before me, until finally your rage<br />
            and hate overcame you. and then we would reunite years later, you<br />
            more powerful than ever and i living in exile in the desert, soon<br />
            reduced to nothing with a single stroke of your blade.</p>
            <div class="origPub"><p>A horribly maximalist poem originally published in the second annual <a href="https://www.instagram.com/poetry4cowards">Open Mic Surgery</a> anthology, a lovely poetry open mic held at <a href="https://neverendingbooks.net/">Never Ending Books</a>. The poem was included in an exhibition at the launch of the book. Reading it is meant to be as exhausting as the relationship was, but I do not know if that really makes for good poetry in the end.</p></div><!-- CHANGE INITIAL VIEWPORT -->
