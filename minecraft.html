  <p>Welcome to my Minecraft server! If you're able to access it, that mean's I've got you on the whitelist; if not, please contact me so I can add you or anyone you want to invite.<br /><br />As for rules, you can pretty much do whatever. Preferably don't grief or vandalize, especially the buildings of the unwilling. You can build in whatever style you like, but I'm hoping to keep the core of the map (around spawn, from like -5000, -5000 to 0, 0. flexibly) in a medieval or high fantasy aesthetic.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U4U8oonRESlnTWz-77CqVMBzYJW_IqFvscr407FbwHo/edit?usp=sharing">A map of server locations and coordinates can be found here.</a></p>
