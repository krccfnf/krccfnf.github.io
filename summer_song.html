        <h1>summer song</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>a flower smell above the street,<br />
            a crumbling stoop between<br />
            Ionic columns all replete<br />
            in marbles gold and green<br /><br />
            I love this ancient promenade<br />
            from days that died an age ago:<br />
            the deco’s art<br />
            (bestill my heart)<br />
            with alabaster trim,<br />
            reminding me<br />
            of fragrant evenings<br />
            spent outside with him<br /><br />
            among the porcelain<br />
            and the stone,<br />
            both white, and overgrown<br />
            with vines<br />
            we sat and spent<br />
            three years alone<br />
            brooding over wine<br /><br />
            time was slow in Sybaris,<br />
            in Corinth there’s no clocks;<br />
            and when the hour struck in Rome<br />
            their hearts were nearly stopped<br /><br />
            but ours began to beat anew,<br />
            the blood was running free;<br />
            and from the forum’s lonely view<br />
            the Palatine was lost in trees.<br /><br />
            the cadence stretched<br />
            and dragged itself<br />
            across our nightly bed,<br />
            and as he slipped away from me<br />
            I wondered what<br />
            the young Dumuzi said.</p>

There is also a typo in the final line, but that is my fault (as it was there in the submission): it ought to be “Dumuzi,” not “Dimuzi.”</p></div>
