        <h1>a talk between the gods</h1>
          <h2>by Matthew Stokdyk</h2>
            <p>Do you remember<br />
            when the world was young<br />
            and we along with it?<br /><br />
            when we budded from nothing<br />
            rosebuds<br />
            on a thornless stem?<br /><br />
            can you not recall<br />
            when our eyes begat the sun<br />
            just to share the evening?<br /><br />
            sang out the birdsong<br />
            for the nightingale to take up<br />
            and repeat forever?<br /><br />
            or when you started humming<br />
            and from it came the bees<br />
            (and I found the honey tasted like you)?<br /><br />
            was it you or I<br />
            who fashioned the clouds<br />
            to make a pleasant bed?<br /><br />
            did you not scatter the stars<br />
            and set them tumbling<br />
            just as we had danced?<br /><br />
            and did I not spread the seeds<br />
            to set the meadows rolling<br />
            and give the ground its color?<br /><br />
            do you remember<br />
            when we watched the lands be born<br />
            and feed upon the first rain?<br /><br />
            and can you now see<br />
            the trees have grown old<br />
            and wither at the root?<br /><br />
            have you watched as even the stones<br />
            pelted by hungry rain<br />
            are dying?<br /><br />
            what fate have we<br />
            if all else that has come<br />
            is fading too?<br /><br />
            and what has happened<br />
            to the voice you made for yourself<br />
            which now is so silent?</p>
