<span style="padding-left:3em">From the “Eros and Psyche” episode of Mary Zimmerman’s <span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span>.†</span>
<hr>
<p>† Of note, the tale of Cupid and Psyche isn’t actually found in Ovid’s Metamorphoses; Zimmerman has introduced it from another source.<sup>1</sup></p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup>	a footnote is unimportant;<br />
&ensp;it demands no attention.<br />
&ensp;nevertheless, it persists,<br />
&ensp;edifying, nagging, citing<br />
&ensp;and with snark.<br /><br />
&ensp;it is subjugated, not the story,<br />
&ensp;verse from verse<br />
&ensp;born from reaction;<span style="vertical-align:super">a</span><br />
&ensp;but it’s not truly important,<br />
&ensp;not worthy of the body.<span style="vertical-align:super">b</span><br /><br />
&ensp;feeble words, notes set below—<br />
&ensp;subaltern words, my low language<br />
&ensp;like Dante in Paradise<sup>c</sup><br />
&ensp;pained by the meagerness<br />
&ensp;of human tongues.<br /><br />
&ensp;the old poets prayed for high language<br />
&ensp;to be lifted up up up<sup>d</sup><br />
&ensp;out of the dark;<br />
&ensp;but it’s the modern impulse<br />
&ensp;to beg to be lowered, shoved<br /><br />
&ensp;into the mire and taste the mud.<br />
&ensp;so that’s what I do, footnotes<br />
&ensp;sinking down down down,<br />
&ensp;because undeniably<br />
&ensp;the mud has a rich vintage.<br /><br />
&ensp;it was for a paper on Pompeii<sup>e</sup><br />
&ensp;that I was made to use Chicago style;<br />
&ensp;MLA, my loving mother,<br />
&ensp;frowns upon footnotes<br />
&ensp;while the windy ones demand them.<br /><br />
&ensp;and ever since I’ve been a sucker;<br />
&ensp;note after note after note<br />
&ensp;with all the details, my post-modern sense<br />
&ensp;and barren modern decadence<br />
&ensp;to mark down my drivel.<br /><br />
&ensp;it’s all symbolic, really,<br />
&ensp;evidence of disorder ingrained<br />
&ensp;habituated even into verse,<br />
&ensp;to write down my wrongs<br />
&ensp;and then specify just what I did.<sup>f</sup><br /><br />
&ensp;however, footnotes present a problem<br />
&ensp;for readers: do you roll on, not stopping<br />
&ensp;or pausing at each marker<br />
&ensp;to see what secret might be divined?<br />
&ensp;looking down to footnotes<br /><br />
&ensp;with each breath tends<br />
&ensp;to fragment the whole poem<sup>g</sup><br />
&ensp;to tear it to bits<br />
&ensp;and render it absolutely<br />
&ensp;incoherent.<sup>h</sup><br /><br />
&ensp;but perhaps that’s best,<br />
&ensp;most accurate to life<br />
&ensp;to glimpse the parentheticalness<sup>i</sup><br />
&ensp;of hands so compelled<br />
&ensp;to scribble down everything.</p>
<hr>
a	alluding to Eliot here
	would suffice, but
	I don’t know if
	my mind is platinum;
	platinum doesn’t rust.
b	as I a footnote
	to yours, unworthy
c	Oh quanto è corto il dire e come fioco
	al mio concetto!
d	what in me is dark
	Illumine, what is low raise and support, or
	μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ (but whose wrath?
	mine, or the reader’s? or even Achilles?)I
e	I would bury all of Manhattan, too,
	if I could learn to write a decent villanelle.
f	I believe in every one writing poetry who wants to; most do. I believe in every man knowing enough of music to play “God bless our home” on the harmonium, but I do not believe in every man giving concerts and printing his sin.II
g	to prove a point
	I must put this here;
	but pretend I meant to quote
	These fragments I have shored against my ruinsIII
h	If Napoleon if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would he like it if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would he like it if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him. If I told him if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him. If I told him would he like it would he like it if I told him.
i	and death i think is no parenthesis
_______________

I	or ought we get back, back, back to it? to you?
II	I really don’t think anyone should’ve been surprised
	when he turned out to be a fascist.
III	though really,
	it must be clear
	this poem is both the fragments
	and the ruins.</p> -->
