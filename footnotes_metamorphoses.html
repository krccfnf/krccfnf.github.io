<p>†	Of note, the tale of Cupid and Psyche isn’t actually found in Ovid’s Metamorphoses; Zimmerman has introduced it from another source.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>	a footnote is unimportant;<br />
&ensp;it demands no attention.<br />
&ensp;nevertheless, it persists,<br />
&ensp;edifying, nagging, citing<br />
&ensp;and with snark.<br /><br />
&ensp;it is subjugated, not the story,<br />
&ensp;verse from verse<br />
&ensp;born from reaction;a<br />
&ensp;but it’s not truly important,<br />
&ensp;not worthy of the body.b<br /><br />

	feeble words, notes set below—
	subaltern words, my low language
	like Dante in Paradisec
	pained by the meagerness
	of human tongues.

	the old poets prayed for high language
	to be lifted up up upd
	out of the dark;
	but it’s the modern impulse
	to beg to be lowered, shoved

	into the mire and taste the mud.
	so that’s what I do, footnotes
	sinking down down down,
	because undeniably
	the mud has a rich vintage.

	it was for a paper on Pompeiie
	that I was made to use Chicago style;
	MLA, my loving mother,
	frowns upon footnotes
	while the windy ones demand them.

	and ever since I’ve been a sucker;
	note after note after note
	with all the details, my post-modern sense
	and barren modern decadence
	to mark down my drivel.

	it’s all symbolic, really,
	evidence of disorder ingrained
	habituated even into verse,
	to write down my wrongs
	and then specify just what I did.f

	however, footnotes present a problem
	for readers: do you roll on, not stopping
	or pausing at each marker
	to see what secret might be divined?
	looking down to footnotes

	with each breath tends
	to fragment the whole poemg
	to tear it to bits
	and render it absolutely
	incoherent.h

	but perhaps that’s best,
	most accurate to life
	to glimpse the parentheticalnessi
	of hands so compelled
	to scribble down everything.
_______________

a	alluding to Eliot here
	would suffice, but
	I don’t know if
	my mind is platinum;
	platinum doesn’t rust.
b	as I a footnote
	to yours, unworthy
c	Oh quanto è corto il dire e come fioco
	al mio concetto!
d	what in me is dark
	Illumine, what is low raise and support, or
	μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ (but whose wrath?
	mine, or the reader’s? or even Achilles?)I
e	I would bury all of Manhattan, too,
	if I could learn to write a decent villanelle.
f	I believe in every one writing poetry who wants to; most do. I believe in every man knowing enough of music to play “God bless our home” on the harmonium, but I do not believe in every man giving concerts and printing his sin.II
g	to prove a point
	I must put this here;
	but pretend I meant to quote
	These fragments I have shored against my ruinsIII
h	If Napoleon if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would he like it if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would he like it if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him. If I told him if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him. If I told him would he like it would he like it if I told him.
i	and death i think is no parenthesis
_______________

I	or ought we get back, back, back to it? to you?
II	I really don’t think anyone should’ve been surprised
	when he turned out to be a fascist.
III	though really,
	it must be clear
	this poem is both the fragments
	and the ruins.
